# react-scripts

This package includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
Please refer to its documentation:

- [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.
- [User Guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Modernizr

The modernizr config (in `modernizr-config.json`) is based on `packages/react-scripts/polyfills.js` and usage of the items in the config across apps.
The `modernizr.js` file is generated from the config in the `prepare` script when installed and published.
